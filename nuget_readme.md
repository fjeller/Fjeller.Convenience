# Fe.Convenience
A collection of convenience Methods and classes, mostly Extension methods, that provide some standard functionality for .NET Applications.

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of extension methods and other classes for common .NET types, designed to simplify development and improve 
code readability. The reason to create this package was basically to have some convenience extension methods ready which I had to write everytime 
in every project.

Currently in alpha. Not all methods/classes are available yet. 

## How to Use

## How to Run Tests
